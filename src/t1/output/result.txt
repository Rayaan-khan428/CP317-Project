osting by EAbstract The adsorptive collection of zinc(II) complex with alizarin ligand, coupled with the
square-wave voltammetric technique at the hanging mercury drop electrode, yields a very sensitive
electroanalytical procedure for the determination of zinc. The optimized experimental conditions
include: supporting electrolyte (carbonate buffer), pH (11), alizarin concentration (1 · 106!
mol l1), accumulation time (60 s), accumulation potential (0.1 V), scan rate (700 mV s1), pulse
amplitude (0.06 V) and SW frequency (80 Hz). The monitored stripping voltammetric current was
linear over the range of 5 · 108 – 4 · 107 mol l1 and the detection limit was 1 · 108 mol l1. The
relative standard deviation was calculated as 1.3% (n= 10) for 1 · 108 mol l1 Zn(II) and the
obtained electrochemical signal was stabile for up to 60 min. Possible interferences by either co-
existing metal ions or other chelating agents were also investigated. The applicability of the
proposed SW-AdSV method to the analysis of foodstuff was assessed by the determination of zinc
content in instant coffee samples. The accuracy of the obtained voltammetric analytical results was
validated by comparing with that obtained by atomic absorption spectrometric method and con-
ducting the necessary statistical evaluation.

lsevierbe used to perform an electroanalytical measurement faster
than conventional differential pulse voltammetry and with
higher sensitivity. The unique features and problems of this
outstanding electrochemical method are reported in several
monographs (Brainina and Neyman, 1993; Wang, 1994;
Dewald, 1996). SW-AdSV procedure is well suited for the
determination of ultra-trace amounts of inorganic ions
through the adsorbed complexes. The applications of this
advanced electrochemical method to the determination of var-
ious metal ions have been reviewed elsewhere (Brainina et al.,
2000; Abu Zuhri and Wolfgang, 1998; Zaitsev et al., 1999).
In adsorptive stripping voltammetric approach, the metal
ion of interest is absorbed on the working electrode by means
of a non-electrolytic process prior to the voltammetric scan. By
this electroanalytical technique, the analytes are determined as

2 A.H. Alghamdicomplexes with different organic ligands adsorbed on the elec-
trode surface. Over the years a large number of chelating
agents of various classes were used for the determination of
more than sixty elements in almost all groups of periodic sys-
tem of elements (Zaitsev et al., 1999). Dimethylglyoxime
(DMG), 8-hydroxyquinoline (Oxine), nioxime, catechol, cup-
ferron, tropolone and solochrome violet RS are some selected
examples of such very popular chelating agents. Alizarin is a
natural dye and chelating agent, which has been used success-
fully in the stripping voltammetric determination of some met-
als including Mo (Tyszczuk and Korolczuk, 2008), Al(III)
(Wang et al., 1987), In(III) (Zhao et al., 1996).
The determination of trace concentration levels of zinc is of
interest in different fields such as environmental surveillance,
food control and occupational hazards (Venugopal and Luc-
key, 1978; Underwoodm, 1977). Because of the industrial sig-
nificant of zinc and as well as its environmental concern, a
sensitive and yet simple analytical method for its trace determi-
nation is required. Accordingly, adsorptive stripping voltam-
metry has been effectively employed for the determination of
zinc ions in various real samples after its prior complexation
with some organic surface-active substances such as Morin
(Shams et al., 2004), 2-quinolinethiol (Paneli and Voulgaropo-
ulos, 1994, tetramethylene dithiocarbamate (TMDC) Hernan-
dez-Brito et al., 1993, ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate
(APDC) Ornella et al., 1995; Van, 1985, propyl gallate (Young
et al., 2003), carbidopa (Gholivand et al., 2007) and xylenol or-
ange (Colston and Robinson, 1997).
The present work examines the reliability and validity of
SW-AdSV electrochemical method for the determination of
trace amounts of zinc in food samples via the application of
alizarin as a chelating agent.2. Experimental
2.1. Apparatus
All square-wave adsorptive stripping measurements were car-
ried out with 797 AV computrace (Metrohn, Herisau, Switzer-
land) in connection with Dell computer and controlled by (VA
computrace 2.0) control software. Stripping voltammograms
were obtained via a Hewlett–Packard laser jet printer. A con-
ventional three electrode system was used in the hanging mer-
cury drop electrode (HMDE) mode. This three electrode
system was completed by means of a platinum auxiliary elec-
trode and an Ag/AgCl (3 M KCl) reference electrode. Atomic
absorption spectrometric determination of zinc metal was
achieved by Perkin–Elmer Flame Atomizer (Model 2280).
The pH was measured with Metrohn 744 pH meter. Oxford
adjustable micropipette (Ireland) was used to pipette microliter
volumes standard solutions.
2.2. Reagents
All chemicals used were of analytical reagent grade and were
used without further purification. Stock solution of Zn(II) of
1 · 102 mol1 was prepared by dissolving the appropriate
amount of nitrate salts (BDH, UK) in distilled water in 100-
ml volumetric flasks. A 1 · 102 mol1 stock solution of aliza-
rin (BDH, UK) was prepared by dissolving an accurately
weighed amount of pure substances. Standard solutions of zincmetal ions or ligands with lower concentration were prepared
daily by diluting the stock solutions with distilled water.
Britton–Robinson supporting buffer (pH  2, 0.04 mol l1 in
each constituent) was prepared by dissolving 2.47 g of boric
acid (Winlab, UK) in 500 ml distilled water containing 2.3 ml
of glacial acetic acid (BDH, UK) and then adding 2.7 ml of
ortho-phosphoric acid (Riedal-deHaen, Germany) and dilut-
ing to 1 l with distilled water. The carbonate buffer was 0.1
mol l1 in both sodium hydrogen carbonate (Winlab, UK)
and disodium carbonate (BDH, UK), while phosphate buffer
was prepared from 0.1 mol l1 in both phosphoric acid (Rie-
dal-deHaen, Germany) and sodium dihydrogen phosphate
(Winlab, UK). The acetate buffer was prepared from 0.02 M
in both sodium acetate (Winlab, UK) and acetic acid (BDH,
UK). Five different brands of popular instant coffee samples
were purchased from city of Riyadh markets.
2.3. Procedure
The general procedure adopted for obtaining square-wave
adsorptive stripping voltammograms was as follows: a 20 ml
aliquot of an appropriate buffer at desired pH was pipetted
in a clean and dry voltammetric cell and the required standard
solutions of the alizarin chelating agent and zinc metal ion
were added. The test solutions were purged with nitrogen for
5 min initially, while the solution was stirred. The accumula-
tion potential of 0.1 V versus Ag/AgCl was applied to a
new mercury drop while the solution was stirred for 60 s (un-
less otherwise stated). Following the preconcentration period,
the stripping was stopped and after 10 s had elapsed, cathodic
scans were carried out over the range from 0.0 to 1.3 V. For
the analysed foodstuff samples (instant coffee) a pretreatment
conventional wet digestion method utilizing acid mixture
was applied. All measurements were obtained at room
temperature.3. Results and discussion
3.1. Preliminary observations
For test solution (acetate buffer pH 3) containing 5 · 106
mol l1 Zn(II), preliminary stripping voltammetric measure-
ments should that zinc ions exhibited a very weak and nearly
flatted electrochemical peak at Ep = 958 mV (versus Ag/
AgCl reference electrode) as can be seen from Fig. 1 (line A).
However, the addition of 3 · 107 mol l1 alizarin to the previ-
ous acetate supporting electrolyte solution provided a well-de-
fined (line B) cathodic peak at 952 mV. In fact, the zinc ions
exhibited a good affinity towards alizarin molecules forming a
very stable alizarin–Zn(II) complex which is strongly adsorbed
onto the HMDE surface. This obtained well-developed strip-
ping voltammetric peak was found to response perfectly to
the extra addition of either 5 · 107 mol l1 alizarin or 5 · 10
7 mol l1 Zn(II) (lines C and D, respectively), which probably
reflect the formation and adsorption of the suggested complex.
The observed SW-AdSV peak is most probably due to the
cathodic reduction of Zn(II) in the adsorbed complex with
alizarin and the electrochemical mechanism of the reduction
process of alizarin–Zn(II) complex is illustrated in Fig. 2.
Clearly, this proposed electrochemical reduction mecha-
nism suggested an irreversible reductive process for zinc ions

Determination of zinc by square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry using alizarin as a chelating agent 3in the adsorbed complex, an assumption which was confirmed
by cyclic voltammetric measurement of 1 · 107 mol l1 Zn(II)
ions and 5 · 107 mol l1 alizarin chelating agent in pH 3 ace-
tate buffer at 50 mV s1 scan rate. As can be noticed from
Fig. 3, which exhibits the cyclic voltammogram of alizarin–
Zn(II) complex, the absence of the anodic peak at the reverse
scan for the stripping voltammetric peak at 831 mV con-
firmed the irreversible nature of the evaluated reduction pro-
cess. The first electrochemical peak observed at 655 mV in
the given cyclic voltammogram is more probably resulted from
the cathodic reduction of the electroactive anthraquinone moi-
ety in the alizarin free molecules. Furthermore, when repetitive
cyclic voltammetric measurements for alizarin complex with
Zn(II) were carried out, a well-developed SW-AdSV peak
was observed at 841 mV for the first cathodic scan, however,O

employed working electrode. Anyhow, the interfacial accumu-
lation of this ligand–metal ion complex onto the HMDE sur-
face can be used as an effective accumulation step in order
to enhance the electroanalytical determination of zinc ions.
3.2. Optimum parameters and experimental conditions
3.2.1. Effect of pH
The sensitivity of the SW-AdSV approach for the electrochem-
ical analysis of Zn(II) metal ion via their formed complex with
alizarin, is strongly dependent upon the pH and nature of sup-
porting buffer which are the main factors influencing the for-
mation of the observed complex, its stability, its adsorption
process and its electrochemical reduction process. Among the
investigated supporting electrolytes (acetate, phosphate, car-
bonate and Britton–Robinson buffer) at different pH values,
the best voltammetric peak resolution and sensitivity have
been observed when utilizing 0.1 mol l1 carbonate buffer,
which will be selected for all subsequent experiments.
The influence of pH value of the used buffer solution on the
monitored stripping voltammetric peak current and potential
was also investigated. When the SW-AdSV peak current of
5 · 107 mol l1 Zn(II) in the presence of 1 · 106 mol l1 aliz-
arin was measured as a function of pH over the range 7.5–11.5,
the zinc voltammetric signal was found to increase steadily
over the examined pH range as can be seen from Fig. 4. How-O

accumulation time at 0.0 V accumulation potential and 500 mV s1 scan rate.
4 A.H. Alghamdiever, a sharp peak current decline was observed at pH 11.5,
thus carbonate buffer solution with pH 11 seems to be the
appropriate choice to ensure the highest voltammetric peak
current. In addition, it was observed that the peak potentials
for Zn/alizarin complex exhibited a shift in the negative direc-
tion by 149 mV, when pH value was varied over the 7.5–11.5
pH range.
3.2.2. Effect of alizarin ligand concentration
Varying the concentration of alizarin chelating agent also
plays an important role in the investigated stripping voltam-
metric procedure. Fig. 5 indicates that an increase of alizarin
concentration from 1 · 107 to 1 · 106 mol l1 at a constant
Zn(II) concentration of 1 · 107 mol l1 initiate a steady
enhancement for the current intensity of the monitored SW-
AdSV signal. However, addition of higher alizarin concentra-
tion level (2 · 106 mol l1 – 4 · 106 mol l1) caused leveling
off of the voltammetric peak height. Accordingly, it seems that
alizarin concentration of 1 · 106 mol l1 might be adequate
to ensure maximum stripping voltammetric, hence, for further
work this chelating agent concentration was selected.0.000000 0.000001 0

Fig. 6 illustrates the relationship of the stripping voltammetric
peak current versus accumulation time for 1 · 107 mol l1
Zn(II) with 1 · 106 mol l1 alizarin over various adsorption
times. Variation of the accumulation time over the range 0–
150 s at a preconcentration potential of 0.0 V showed a grad-
ual enhancement for Zn(II) SW-AdSV peak current up to
60 s and decreased with longer preconcentration times. As a
consequence, accumulation time of 60 s was selected as an
optimum for further studies.
When the adsorption of formed alizarin–Zn(II) complex
was measured as a function of accumulation potential at
60 s collection time over the range from +0.2 V to 0.8 V, it
was observed that monitored peak current increased
slightly when applying 0.1 V as the optimal accumulation
potential.
3.2.4. Effect of potential sweep conditions
The scan rate parameter of the voltammetric technique was
also varied in order to establish the optimum scan rate for
the developed SW-AdSV procedure. It was found that the aliz-.000002 0.000003 0.000004

Determination of zinc by square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry using alizarin as a chelating agent 5arin–Zn(II) SW-AdSV peak height increased gradually, over
100–1000 mV s1 scan rate range. However, the width and
the shape of the examined stripping voltammetric peak slightly
distorted when utilizing scan rate higher than 700 mV s1.
Consequently, 700 mV s1 scan rate is recommended as an
optimal for subsequent electroanalytical studies. The depen-
dence of SW-AdSV peak currents on scan rate is presented
in Fig. 7.
Moreover, the impact of varying the square-wave fre-
quency on the SW-AdSV current intensity was also evalu-
ated. The effect of this operating variable was studied over
the range 20–90 Hz and it was concluded that in order to as-
sure maximum peak current, 80 Hz square-wave frequency
was the ideal choice for this operational parameter. Addition-
ally, varying the value of excitation wave pulse amplitude
also plays an important role for the measured stripping vol-
tammetric current intensity. Increasing this parameter over
the range 0.01–0.1 V, resulted in a substantial enhancement
of the voltammetric peak current up to 0.06 V value and
gradually decreased thereafter. Hence, for further electro-
chemical investigation, 0.06 V excitation wave pulse ampli-
tude value was adopted.3.2.5. Effect of instrumental parameters
The monitored SW-AdSV peak current can be further maxi-
mized by optimizing other experimental factors that can affect
the adsorption accumulation process for the formed alizarin–
Zn(II) complex. The influence of the surface size of the mer-
cury drop working electrode on the observed stripping voltam-
metric response was evaluated. The relationship between the
measured peak current and the surface area of the drop was
found to be linear for the surface areas of 0.15–0.60 mm2.
For optimal sensitivity, 0.60 mm2 drop surface area (drop size
8) will be used for all next electrochemical measurements. In
addition, the effect of convection rate was also studied by
ascending the stirring rate from 100 to 3000 rpm. Although
3000 rpm stirring rate provided the maximum peak height,
yet, 2000 rpm stirring speed was chosen as optimum value,
which provided adequate preconcentration effect without
affecting the drop stability.

tion plot for this metal ion was recorded to estimate the ana-
lytical characteristics of the developed SW-AdSV method.
3.3.1. Calibration graph and detection limit
The dependence of alizarin–Zn(II) voltammetric peak current
on the concentration of Zn(II) was obtained when successive
additions of the standard Zn(II) solution were added to the
voltammetric cell. As represented in Fig. 8, a proportional
and linear relationship between Zn(II) and the monitored
SW-AdSV signal was observed. Least squares analysis of the
studied concentration range (5 · 108–4 · 107 mol l1)
yielded the following regression equation:
ip ðnAÞ ¼ 911þ 5:94 109 C ðmol L1Þ r ¼ 0:996 n ¼ 5
where ip is the stripping voltammetric peak current in amperes,
C is the analysed zinc metal ion concentration and r is the cor-
relation coefficient.
The effective preconcentration during the adsorption pro-
cess of the formed complex makes it possible to achieve a very
low detection limits. For this metal ion analysed via the opti-
mized SW-AdSV procedure, the detection limit of 1 · 108
mol l1 was calculated based on the signal-to-noise (S/
Zn(II) Conc
Figure 8 Calibration graph for Zn(II) in the presence of 1 · 106 mol
0.1 V accumulation potential and 700 mV s1 scan rate.3.3.2. Reproducibility and stability
The high sensitivity of SW-AdSV approach is also accompa-
nied by good precision of the obtained results. This can be
attributed to the reproducible HMDE surface area and
adsorption process for the formed alizarin–Zn(II) complex.
Under the previously experimental optimized conditions, the
reproducibility of the measured analytical signals was checked
from 10 successive measurements of 1 · 107 mol l1 Zn(II) in
the presence of 1 · 106 mol l1 alizarin. The precision of the
method in terms of relative standard deviation was 1.3
RSD%. The stability of 1 · 107 mol l1 Zn(II) solution was
also investigated and monitored electrochemical signal was
fond to give nearly a constant voltammetric current intensity
up to 60 min.
3.3.3. Interference studies
The major sources of interferences are likely to be from co-
exciting metal ions capable of forming complexes with the used
chelating agent, hence, affecting SW-AdSV response via an
overlapping peak or competing for adsorptive sites or available
ligand. The effect of the following ions, which are of great sig-
nificance in industrial or environmental matrices, was tested at
the optimal experimental conditions. As a matter of fact, the
interfering metal ions were added at different concentrations2.50E-007 3.00E-007 3.50E-007 4.00E-007 4.50E-007

Determination of zinc by square-wave adsorptive stripping voltammetry using alizarin as a chelating agent 7(1-fold, 5-fold and 20-fold) higher than the concentration of
Zn(II) (1 · 107 mol l1). Actually, very mild or no significant
interference was observed upon adding 1-fold or 5-fold con-
centration of Pb(II), Fe(III), Fe(II), Al(III) and Cd(II). How-
ever, the presence of Cd(II) at higher concentration (20-fold)
caused 19.8% decrease in zinc voltammetric peak current.
On the other hand, the noticeable interference influence was
observed when Cu(II) and Ni(II) metal ions were present in
the test solution especially at higher concentration levels (20-
fold). In fact, the monitored Zn(II) voltammetric peak height
increased by 34% and 38% of its original height after the addi-
tion of 20-fold of Cu(II) and Ni(II), respectively.
Furthermore, the competitive effect of complexing agents
on the Zn(II) SW-AdSV peak current was modeled by the
additions of 5 · 107 mol l1 and 1 · 106 mol l1 of some
other chelating agent such as EDTA, DMG and cupferone
to the test solution. There was totally no effect for the addition
of EDTA and DMG chelating agents at these concentration le-
vel on the stripping voltammetric peak current of Zn(II) metal
ion. However, a very mild increase in the SW-AdSV peak
height by 5.7% after the addition of 1 · 106 mol l1 cupfer-
one ligand.
3.4. Analytical applications and accuracy
In order to validate the practical reliability of the optimized
SW-AdSV method, five different foodstuff samples (namely in-
stant coffee) were analysed for their zinc contents by the rec-
ommended voltammetric procedure (Table 1) after
conventional wet digestion. In fact, zinc concentrations were
calculated via the standard addition approach in order to min-
imize the sample matrix interference. Typical analytical results
correspond to the mean values of four replicate determinations
are summarized in Table 2. The accuracy of the developed elec-
troanalytical method was verified by comparing the analytical
results obtained by SW-AdSV method with that obtained by
atomic absorption spectrometric (AAS) method for the same
instant coffee samples. As can be seen from Table 2, the results
obtained by the developed voltammetric method compared
favorably with those obtained by the spectroscopic reference
method. The agreement of the compared result was tested by
the paired t-test statistical approach (Miller and Miller,1994). The means of both analytical methods were found to
be not differ significantly, since all the calculated t-test value
were less than the critical value (2.45) at the 95% confidence
level (P = 0.05). There is no statistical evidence that the means
of the proposed voltammetric method differ significantly from
the means of the reference methods (null hypotheses is
obtained).Acknowledgements
