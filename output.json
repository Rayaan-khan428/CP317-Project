Cloud computing is a major part of the software industry and has\nhad a lasting impact on how we ensure the world’s software can run and evolve.\n***END OF PAGE 1***\n\n***START OF PAGE 2***\n1. INTRODUCTION\nCloud computing as defined by IBM is: “On-demand access, via the internet, to\ncomputing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage,\ndevelopment tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed\nby a cloud services provider (or CSP)” (IBM, n.d. -a). Cloud computing can be scaled more\neasily than on premise storage options and has the ability to lower IT costs by outsourcing\ncertain efforts related to the development of personalized infrastructure (IBM, n.d. -a).\nSpeed is a large factor in many businesses' decisions to opt for cloud-based storage\nsolutions; the speed at which you can scale up or down and integrate software from within the\ncloud is remarkable compared to past techniques. Speed is also a major factor in software\ndevelopment, matching the speed at which competitors release new versions and develop their\nequivalent software is of great importance, and utilizing the cloud is one way in which the\nsoftware development cycle can be expedited to help ensure a project does not become obsolete\nbefore its release.\nA common misconception about cloud computing is that it lacks security when in fact\ncloud based computing is likely more secure than in house equivalents. Cloud computing\nplatforms are designed with great expertise and because high volumes of important information\nis stored on the cloud providers recognize the need for thorough security measures. Security\nlevels can be made highly complex depending on an individual's needs and robust security\nmeasures are wrapped around data within the cloud to maintain security as a top priority\n(Alvarez).\n2. OVERVIEW\nSome of the key characteristics of cloud computing include: being an OnDemand service,\nallowing for broad network access, scalability, and heightened security (Novkovic, 2017).\nSoftware available on the cloud can be accessed anywhere network access, making it highly\nportable and offering flexibility to those who use it. The security and ability to scale up or down\nat a moment’s notice previously discussed, leads into the OnDemand aspect of cloud computing.\nPaid services and needs can be altered simultaneously leaving less room for overpaying for\nservices, which makes cloud computing highly adaptable.\nWhile these characteristics seem to be commonsensical, they were not always the\nindustry standard. Companies previously had no choice but to have large centers to store their\ndata. The history of cloud computing is rich in innovation, as consumer needs demanded better\nsolutions to software storage. Cloud computing can be traced back to as early as 1960 when\nJoseph Carl Robnett Licklider worked on a network research project that strived to connect\npeople and data worldwide (Pedamkar, 2023). In the 1990’s companies started to offer Virtual\nPrivate Network services (VPNs) which remain popular today and truly set the stage for the\ncloud computing take over. By 2006 massive tech companies such as Google and Amazon began\nusing the term cloud computing and made their cloud platforms easily accessible (Regalado,\nThere are several options for cloud computing models depending on user needs, as well\nas providers for these models. Some key players in the cloud computing scene include but are\nnot limited to: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud platform, Alibaba Cloud,\nand Oracle Cloud (Zhang, 2023). A cloud provider may or may not be required for some cloud\ncomputing models. The main four models we will explore in detail will be Public, Private,\n***END OF PAGE 2***\n\n***START OF PAGE 3***\nHybrid and Community models. The different models suit a variety of factors which will also be\nexplored.\n3. CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS\nCloud deployment models play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of modern\ncomputing. As organizations increasingly embrace cloud computing, understanding the various\ndeployment models becomes essential for making informed decisions about resource allocation,\nsecurity, and scalability.\nThe four primary cloud deployment models are public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud,\nand community cloud. Each cloud deployment model has its advantages and considerations, and\nthe choice depends on factors such as data sensitivity, compliance requirements, scalability\nneeds, budget, and organizational preferences. Many organizations opt for a multi-cloud\napproach, combining different deployment models to create a customized and optimal cloud\nenvironment.\nA. Public Cloud:\nThe public cloud is a cloud computing model that enables widespread accessibility to\nsystems and services. It is available to the general public and major industry groups, but it may\nbe perceived as less secure due to its openness. In this model, cloud infrastructure services are\ndelivered over the internet by third-party providers, and the infrastructure is owned by the\nservice provider rather than the consumer. Public cloud hosting allows for easy access to systems\nand services. Providers offer storage backup, retrieval services, and more either for free, through\nsubscription models, or based on the number of users.\nProminent public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft\nAzure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This cloud model emphasizes scalability, cost-\neffectiveness, and user-friendly payment structures where users pay for the resources they utilize\non a pay-as-you-go basis, while sacrificing guaranteed high-level security and customizability\n(GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c)\nB. Private Cloud:\nThe private cloud deployment model stands in direct contrast to the public cloud\ndeployment model, as it creates an exclusive environment for a single user or customer. In the\nprivate cloud, there is no need to share hardware resources with other users. It grants access to\nsystems and services within a specific organization or defined boundary. This cloud platform is\nimplemented in a secure environment protected by robust firewalls and managed by the\norganization's IT department.\nThe private cloud provides enhanced control over cloud resources, allowing organizations\nto exercise greater flexibility and customization. It offers similar advantages to the public cloud,\nsuch as scalability and self-service capabilities, but with the added benefits of increased security\nand tailored management (GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c). Private clouds can be hosted either on-\npremises within an organization's data center or by a trusted third-party provider, catering to the\nspecific needs of organizations with regulatory requirements or sensitive data.\nThe drawbacks include limited scalability due to a smaller number of clients and higher\ncosts resulting from the provision of personalized facilities.\nC. Hybrid Cloud:\n***END OF PAGE 3***\n\n***START OF PAGE 4***\nHybrid cloud computing combines the best of both public and private cloud worlds by\nutilizing proprietary software to bridge the two. This approach allows organizations to host their\napplications in a secure environment while also benefiting from the cost savings offered by the\npublic cloud. By employing a combination of multiple cloud deployment methods, organizations\ncan seamlessly transfer data and applications between different clouds based on their specific\nrequirements.\nThe hybrid cloud model offers advantages such as flexibility and control, allowing\nbusinesses to tailor solutions to their specific needs. It also provides cost savings since scalability\nin public clouds means paying only for additional capacity when required. However, managing\nhybrid clouds can be challenging due to the complexity of combining public and private clouds.\nData transmission in the hybrid cloud occurs through the public cloud, leading to potential\nlatency issues (GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c).\nD. Community Cloud:\nThe community cloud is a distributed system that allows a group of organizations to\naccess systems and services tailored to their specific needs. It involves integrating the services of\ndifferent clouds to create an infrastructure shared among organizations within a community,\nindustry, or business. This shared infrastructure is typically managed either by a third-party\nprovider or by a combination of organizations within the community.\nCommunity clouds are designed to meet the requirements of specific communities, such\nas government agencies, research institutions, or industry consortiums. By sharing costs,\nresources, and infrastructure, community members maintain control over their own data and\napplications while benefiting from collaboration opportunities, resource pooling, and specialized\nservices that cater to their unique needs.\nSome disadvantages include limited scalability due to resource sharing among\norganizations based on collaborative interests and restrictions on customization, as modifications\nby one organization can impact others sharing the same data and resources (GeeksForGeeks, n.d.\n-c).\n4. ARCHITECHTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE OF CLOUD\nCOMPUTING\nThe architecture and infrastructure of cloud computing are designed to provide scalable,\nflexible, and cost-effective solutions for businesses and individuals. To support these goals, cloud\ncomputing offers different service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform\nas a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).\nA. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):\nIaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can access and\nmanage virtual machines, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources from a\ncloud service provider (CSP). It offers a high level of flexibility and control, allowing users to\nscale their infrastructure up or down based on their individual/organizational needs.\nThe responsibility for managing and maintaining the infrastructure lies with the CSP,\nallowing you to focus on tasks such as software installation, configuration, and management, as\nwell as ensuring the security of your data (Google, n.d. -c).\nB. Platform as a Service (PaaS):\n***END OF PAGE 4***\n\n***START OF PAGE 5***\nPaaS provides a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications. Similar to\nIaaS models, in PaaS, the service provider takes care of delivering and managing the underlying\ninfrastructure. While you are responsible for coding, handling data, and managing your\napplications, the burden of managing and maintaining the platform itself is alleviated.\nPaaS solutions are specific to application and software development and typically include:\n• Cloud infrastructure: Data centers, storage, network equipment, and servers\n• Middleware software: Operating systems, frameworks, development kits (SDK),\nlibraries, and more\n• User interface: A graphical user interface (GUI), a command line interface (CLI), an API\ninterface, and in some cases, all three (Google, n.d. -e).\nC. Software as a Service (SaaS):\nThrough SaaS, software applications are hosted and delivered over the internet. Users can\naccess and use software applications without the need for local installation or management which\nprovides convenience, accessibility, and comes with automatic software updates. Some key\nfeatures of SaaS include:\n• Application Accessibility: SaaS applications are accessible through web browsers or\ndedicated client applications, allowing users to access them from various devices and\nlocations.\n• Multi-Tenancy: SaaS applications support multiple users or organizations sharing the\nsame software instance while maintaining data separation and security.\n• Subscription-based Model: SaaS typically operates on a subscription-based pricing\nmodel, where users pay for the software on a recurring basis (SalesForce, n.d.).\nD. Virtualization and its role in cloud computing:\nVirtualization plays a fundamental role in enabling the service models of previously\nmentioned above. Through virtualization, the cloud service provider can efficiently allocate and\nmanage resources, dynamically scale up or down based on demand, and ensure the isolation and\nsecurity of user environments. It is the foundation that enables the scalability, flexibility, and\nagility that cloud computing is known for (AWS, n.d.).\nVirtualization uses specialized software, called a hypervisor, to create several cloud\ninstances or virtual machines on one physical computer. From the user’s perspective, the virtual\nmachine operates like a typical server. CPUs, Random Access Memory (RAM), and storage\nappear the same as on a physical server. You can also configure and update the guest operating\nsystems and their applications as necessary without affecting the host operating system (AWS,\nn.d.).\nThe hypervisor is installed on the physical machine, serving as a mediator between the\nvirtual machines and the underlying hardware or host operating system. It operates as a software\nlayer that facilitates the allocation of physical resources to multiple virtual machines. By\ncoordinating access to the physical environment, the hypervisor ensures that each virtual\nmachine has its dedicated portion of resources.\nFor example, if the virtual machine requires computing resources, such as computer\nprocessing power, the request first goes to the hypervisor. The hypervisor then passes the request\nto the underlying hardware, which performs the task (AWS, n.d.).\nThe following are the two main types of hypervisors.\n***END OF PAGE 5***\n\n***START OF PAGE 6***\n• Type 1 hypervisors: Also called a bare-metal hypervisor, runs directly on the computer\nhardware and interacts directly with the physical resources.\n• Type 2 hypervisors: Runs as an application on computer hardware with an existing\noperating system. This type of hypervisor is used when running multiple operating\nsystems on a single machine.\n5. BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING\nA. Benefits of Cloud Computing\nCloud computing has various functionalities and attributes which make it advantageous,\nproviding numerous benefits.\nOne of the major benefits of cloud computing is the fact that it provides scalability.\nScalability in cloud computing refers to the ability of cloud computing to scale the amount of\nresources required for each individual use case, allowing for the demands of services to be met\nwithout the need to invest in physical infrastructures (Google, n.d.-a). This means that businesses\nwhich require the use of things such as data storage and databases are able to scale the amount of\nstorage they need in a seamless manner.\nCost-efficiency is an element of cloud computing that is beneficial due to the fact that\ncloud services provide users with the ability to reduce their investments into physical hardware,\nand to only invest into the cloud services which they specifically need (Google, n.d.-a). This\nallows for business to be more cost efficient, as only resources which are used are provided to\nthe end user (Google, n.d.-a).\nB. Security and Privacy Concerns\nPrivacy and security have been major concerns when regarding the use of cloud\ncomputing, with various reasons as to why these concerns may exist. The cloud is susceptible to\nattacks, which can result in the loss of personal data, which is why security and privacy are of\nhigh importance when regarding the use of the cloud.\nThe confidentiality of data may be compromised during the use of cloud computer\nsoftware. Instances of data theft during a targeted attack may result in a user’s personal data\nbeing stolen, resulting in a privacy breach between the user and the provider of the cloud service\n(GeeksforGeeks, 2023a). The occurrence of a privacy breach can result in the mistrust of a user\nfor a particular cloud service, and the data of the user to be reachable by users who should not\nhave authorization (GeeksforGeeks, 2023a).\nSecurity issues can occur through the use of multi-tenancy for the cloud operation. Multi-\ntenancy is the use of software systems in such a way where the services used by multiple users\nare all accessed on a single server, resulting in more cost-effective, but less secure operation\n(GeeksforGeeks, 2023a). This can result in security concerns, as it allows for attackers to gain\naccess to multiple tenants' data if they are to gain access to the one server (GeeksforGeeks,\nC. Reliability and Availability Issues\nThe reliability and availability issues for cloud computing span to problems which can\naffect a wide range of people. In the context of cloud computing, reliability refers to how often\nfailures occur, and availability refers to the downtime of the cloud service (Ooteghem, 2022).\nIssues in reliability can occur when cloud services are not accessible, when there are frequent\n***END OF PAGE 6***\n\n***START OF PAGE 7***\ninterruptions during use, and if the cloud service is not secure (Ooteghem, 2022). Availability\nissues occur when the cloud services are suffering from service outages, resulting in the\nunavailability of the service to be accessed by users. The lack of availability of a cloud service\ncould impact millions of people, as many cloud services are used worldwide on a daily basis,\naffecting average citizens, businesses, or government entities.\nD. Legal and Regulatory Challenges\nCloud computing can face challenges in the aspects of legality and regulation. Due to the\nnature of cloud computing requiring the transferring and storing of data, the aspect of privacy\nconcerns rise. The European Union created the 1995 Data Protection Directive in order to ensure\nthe protection of personal data and the transfer of such data, resulting in the transfer of user data\nthrough international to only be permitted by US businesses granted permission (Khatri, 2022).\nThe hosting of cloud computer services and the use of its data has resulted in many regulations\nbeing put in place, which could result in these cloud services requiring a higher cost by the end\nuser in order to comply with the regulations which were put in place (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).\n6. CLOUD COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS\nCloud computing and virtualization are distinct concepts that play crucial roles in modern IT\ninfrastructure. While virtualization involves creating virtual computing environments\nindependent of physical infrastructure, cloud computing delivers shared computing resources on\ndemand through the internet. Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations leverage\ntechnology resources, providing scalable and accessible computing capabilities (VMware n.d.).\nVirtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality, enabling multiple virtual\nsystems or instances of applications to run on a single server. This consolidation improves\nefficiency within organizations and achieves economies of scale. Popular virtualization\ntechnologies include VMware, Hyper-V, and Xen. For instance, a large corporation operating a\ndata center previously had each server running only one operating system and hosting a specific\napplication, resulting in underutilization and increased costs. However, by implementing\nvirtualization, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can run on a single physical server, greatly\nreducing the number of servers required and saving costs related to hardware purchases, power\nconsumption, cooling, and a team to manage it all (VMware n.d.).\nContainerization technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, have become widely adopted\nin recent years. Unlike traditional virtualization, containerization creates lightweight and isolated\ncontainers that package applications and their dependencies. Containers ensure consistent\nbehavior across different computing environments and promote scalability, portability, and\nreproducibility, making them well-suited for the cloud computing environment. Developers can\nstreamline application deployment, accelerate software development cycles, and achieve\nefficient resource utilization by leveraging containerization technologies. (Kubernetes, n.d.)\nVarious management tools have also been developed to effectively manage complex cloud\ninfrastructure. These tools automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications\nand services in cloud environments. Kubernetes, for example, provides a platform for\norchestration and management, enabling:\n***END OF PAGE 7***\n\n***START OF PAGE 8***\n1. automated scaling: increase and decrease the number of nodes to meet the incoming\ndemand or lack of at any given time.\n2. load balancing: process of distributing network traffic efficiently among back-end\nservices.\n3. self-healing capabilities: in the event a container fails Kubernetes can automatically\nredeploy the container to its desired state to restore operations.\nCloud providers also offer their own orchestration and management tools, such as Amazon\nElastic Kubernetes Service or Google Kubernetes Engine.\nCloud storage and databases are critical components of cloud computing, allowing\norganizations to store vast amounts of data and access it from anywhere in the world. Industry-\nleading cloud storage options include Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon S3,\nproviding secure and reliable storage for different types of data. These cloud databases eliminate\nthe need for organizations to maintain and manage their own database infrastructure. By\nleveraging cloud storage and databases, businesses can scale their storage and database needs on\ndemand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. (DBMastero, n.d.)\nCloud computing and virtualization are distinct yet interconnected technologies that have\nrevolutionized the IT landscape. Cloud computing offers scalable and on-demand access to\ncomputing resources, while virtualization enables efficient resource utilization within\norganizations. Containerization technologies, management tools like Kubernetes, and reliable\ncloud storage and databases further enhance the capabilities of cloud computing, empowering\nbusinesses to leverage technology resources effectively and achieve their goals.\n7. CLOUD COMPUTING USE CASES AND APPLICATIONS\nWhen it comes to business and enterprises, cloud computing offers great leaps in scalable\nand on-demand access to computing resources, cost savings and increased efficiency as spoken\nabout in the previous section. However, we will explore some specific use cases/applications.\n1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): cloud provides virtualized infrastructure resources such\nas virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities. This allows businesses to\noffload the management and maintenance of hardware infrastructure, reducing costs and\nenabling rapid scalability.\n2. Software as a Service (SaaS): Cloud-based software applications provide businesses with\neasy access to a wide range of productivity tools, customer relationship management\nsystems and enterprise resource planning solutions. An example of a SaaS Company is\nSlack, a cloud-based messaging service geared towards professionals.\n3. Big Data analytics: In today's world many of the decisions a company makes are driven\nby data. But to leverage data it requires an extreme amount of hardware. By utilizing\ncloud-based analytics platforms organizations can make better decisions for the company\nwithout having to invest potentially millions in hardware and an in-house team.\nCloud computing has also permanently changed the way students learn in the 21st century.\nCloud-based learning management systems (LMS) and virtual classrooms has provided students\nthe ability to access course materials, participate in class, and submit assignments from\nanywhere. It has also enabled people in developing countries to get a good level of education,\n***END OF PAGE 8***\n\n***START OF PAGE 9***\nthrough websites like khan academy or universities own courses that are often free online like\nthe infamous Harvard CS50 course (Cloud Academy, n.d.).\nCloud computing in healthcare plays a vital role in helping patients in a very productive way.\nIt has transformed the way patient data is stored, shared, and analyzed. Some key applications of\ncloud computing in healthcare include:\n1. Electronic Health Records (EHR): storing information on the cloud about patients makes\nit accessible for different healthcare professionals, helping to ensure a seamless data\nexchange, helping to improve coordination among departments and effectively reducing\nthe risk of medical errors occurring.\n2. Medical imaging and diagnostic: cloud-based medical imaging platforms store and\nprocess large volumes of medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. Cloud\ncomputing enables healthcare providers to share access to medical images securely,\nfacilitating collaboration among radiologists and specials for accurate diagnoses and\ntreatment planning (Galen Data, n.d.).\nLastly, cloud computing has a profound impact on the government and public sector, helping\nto save tax-payer money and improve the services offered by the government.\n1. E-Government Services have enabled citizens to access government services and\ninformation online. This includes online tax filing, permit applications, and voter\nregistration. It allows all this to be done from home reducing the load on government\noffices that can now serve people who have needs that cannot be completed online.\n2. Government data storage and sharing has been another sector that has been\nrevolutionized due to cloud computing, companies like Amazon work with the US\nGovernment to ensure that the records of citizens is safely kept, as well as sense military\ninfo that would originally be transferable only by physical means across the country can\nnow be accessed anywhere securely (GovOS, 2022).\nCloud computing offers a wide range of use cases and applications across various sectors. In\nbusiness and enterprises, cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure, software services,\ndata storage, and analytics capabilities. In education, cloud computing enables online learning,\ncollaboration, and virtual lab environments. In healthcare, cloud computing facilitates secure\npatient data management, telemedicine, and medical imaging. In the government and public\nsector, cloud computing supports data storage, e-government services, collaboration, and\nemergency response. As technology advances and organizations continue to embrace the benefits\nof cloud computing, its impact will undoubtedly expand, further revolutionizing industries and\nimproving services in the digital age.\n8. FUTURE TRENDS AND CHALLENGES\nA. Edge Computing and its Impact on Cloud Computing\nEdge computing is the processing of data as close to the origin source as possible in order\nto reduce latency and provide better bandwidth. The data being processed closer to the creation\npoint allows for faster data analysis and lower latencies, resulting in a better user experience\n(IBM, n.d.-b).\nThe differences between edge computing and cloud computing is that edge computing\noperates on a time sensitive basis, whereas cloud computing does not, meaning data processed\n***END OF PAGE 9***\n\n***START OF PAGE 10***\nthrough edge computing is processed at a lower signal latency (Arora, 2023). In cloud\ncomputing, data is stored and processed in centralized servers, allowing for higher processing\npower (Kaur, 2023). On the other hand, the infrastructure for edge computing is highly\ndistributed, and typically processed on site at a low processing power (Kaur, 2023). Cloud\ncomputing allows for unlimited storage, reduced hardware costs and quick centralized services,\nwhile edge computing provides lower latency, better bandwidth, real-time computation, and\nbetter privacy (Kaur, 2023).\nThere are challenges to both edge computing and cloud computing. Edge computing may\nsuffer from reliability issues due to its decentralized nature, compatibility issues, and security\nissues for data that is processed outside of the edge servers (Kaur, 2023). Cloud computing may\nsuffer from large data breaches/data losses due to the information being centralized, long\ndowntimes, and a lack of data confidentiality (Kaur, 2023).\nCloud computing can be seen used in applications such as an app on a smartphone, where\nedge computing can be seen used in things such as self-driving cars, where a reduced latency and\nfast response times are required (Kaur, 2023).\nB. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Cloud\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, are used in\ncloud computing in order to teach systems to solve tasks while improving on the solving of these\ntasks over time through the processing of data (Google, n.d.-d).\nThrough the use of data, machine learning processes the data, identifying common\npatterns within the data and making decisions based off of these identified patterns (Google, n.d.-\nd). It allows for systems to learn a program’s tendencies and effectively achieves what is to be\nachieved over time.\nMachine learning is used in a variety of ways, including in services such as fraud\nprevention, digital marketing, security, customer service and sales optimization (Google, n.d.-d).\nC. Serverless computing and Function as a Service (FaaS)\nServerless computing is the ability to create applications without the need of the creation\nof infrastructure, allowing for cloud services to be the primary infrastructure used to process the\ncode (Serverless Computing and Applications | Microsoft Azure, n.d.). Benefits of serverless\ncomputing include efficient allocation of resources, scalability, quicker services, and the lack of\nneed to maintain infrastructure (Serverless Computing and Applications | Microsoft Azure, n.d.).\nThrough serverless computing, developers are able to focus on developing front-end code, while\nthe back-end code is managed by the provider of the cloud service (IBM, n.d.-d).\nTechnologies such as serverless Kubernetes allow for systems that have developers\nprovide containers to a platform which is orchestrated in a manner where it is automatically\nscaled when met with spikes and dips in demand (Serverless Computing and Applications |\nMicrosoft Azure, n.d.).\nFunction as a Service (FaaS) is a service of cloud computing which lets users execute\ncode without managing the infrastructure required for these services (IBM, n.d.-c). The\ndifference between serverless computing and Function as a Service is the fact that Function as a\nService is a subset of serverless computing (IBM, n.d.-c). FaaS focuses on the execution of code\nin response to an event, while serverless computing is broader and multi-faceted, focusing on\nthings such as storage, databases, APIs, computation, or messaging services that are not visible to\nthe end user (IBM, n.d.-c).\n***END OF PAGE 10***\n\n***START OF PAGE 11***\nD. Sustainability and Green Cloud Computing\nSustainability in cloud computing, otherwise known as green cloud computing, is a term\nused in reference to the environmental impacts in regard to cloud computing. Green cloud\ncomputing is a set of goals put in place which aim to reduce carbon emissions and energy\nconsumption by promoting the increase of biodegradable/recyclable products, reducing the use\nof unsafe materials, and increasing energy efficiency (Davis, 2023).\nThe goals of green cloud computing are strived to be achieved through a variety of\nfactors. The components which are found in electronics such as computers and phones contain\nmaterials which are hazardous to the environment; This makes it essential to dispose of\nelectronics properly, and to increase the recyclability/biodegradability of future products.\nEnergy efficiency can be increased through the optimization of the facilities which hold\nthe cloud servers, and the optimization of the infrastructure (Davis, 2023). The facilities are often\nplanned in a manner where the location, architecture, and layout of the building are created in\nsuch a way to be the most energy efficient as possible in order to reduce the heat of the servers,\ngoing to extents such as to be built underground or in the ocean (Davis, 2023).\n9. CASE STUDIES AND SUCCESS STORIES\nA. Real-World Examples of Organizations Leveraging Cloud Computing\nIn recent years, Cloud Computing has become an essential tool for businesses across all\nindustries.  Companies have leveraged cloud computing to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and\nincrease scalability.  Although there are many examples of companies successfully implementing\ncloud computing, we will look at two highly notable examples.\nGeneral Electric doesn’t seem to be a company that could benefit from cloud computing\ngiven they are not directly involved in the tech industry.  However, they have done an excellent\njob leading the pack by starting its cloud-first application deployment strategy in 2014\n(Donnelly, 2017).  Through the use of Amazon Web Service (AWS), they have been able to\nrefocus IT teams from maintenance and expanding data centers to more meaningful tasks\nincluding future innovation.\nFitbit is the perfect company to use a cloud computing model; with their recent switch to\nGoogle Cloud for Healthcare in 2019, they proved exactly that (Google, 2022).  Given the\nbusiness model of Fitbit, they require a large amount of storage space for user health information\nand security is a high priority.  This switch to cloud services has allowed for easier scalability,\neasy access and shareability for users as well as maintaining its security.\nB. Case Studies of Successful Cloud Migrations and Implementations\nCloud migration and implementation vary greatly on a case-to-case basis and ultimately\nto be as successful as possible it needs to be tailored to your specific needs.  Now we will view\nsome specific case studies of how companies were able to design their own cloud migrations to\nlead to success.  Acoustic is an excellent example of migrating in a way that fits your company's\nneeds.\nAcoustic is a marketing technology company that wanted to make the switch to a cloud-\nbased model through Amazon Web Service (AWS) but did not want to renew their current\ncontract meaning they were left with a 10-month window (Boezeman, n.d.).  With the help of\nClearScale, they were able to not only transfer everything over to the cloud in this time frame but\nreap massive benefits.  This switch allowed Acoustic to save millions of dollars, modernize and\noptimize its infrastructure as well as allow for faster process time to market.\n***END OF PAGE 11***\n\n***START OF PAGE 12***\nA second large company that was able to benefit from the switch to Cloud Computing\ngreatly is Pandora.  Pandora is a worldwide industry-leading jewelry company with unique\nrequirements.  Given the large cost of jewelry, a company like Pandora will endure large\nquantities of customers with few purchases per customer.  This means that customers will grow\nto have high expectations as it is a large and meaningful transaction.  In 14 months, they were\nable to decommission 2400 servers and make the full switch to Microsoft Azure’s Cloud service\n(Accenture, 2023).  This switch allowed for a massive save in cost, and an increase in simplicity\nallowing for easier and quicker IT decisions as well as increased agility for consumers.\n10. CONCLUSION\nA. Summary of Key Findings and Insights\nCloud Computing has forever revolutionized and transformed the way companies and\nusers store, access, process and deliver information and services.  It offers a long list of benefits\ndependent on the specific use case but scalability, cost efficiency and flexibility are massive\nbenefits for everyone.  However, that is not to say that it comes without its own challenges\nincluding security, reliability, legal/regulatory constraints and potential privacy issues when\nhandling sensitive data.  In this paper, we have explored cloud deployment models, architecture,\ninfrastructure, benefits, limitations and current technology and tools.  We were also able to apply\nthis to the real world through case studies and examples of companies that have greatly benefited\nfrom implementing a cloud computing model.  In the course of this paper, we hope to have\ncontributed to the understanding and appreciation of cloud computing by exploring the power of\ncloud computing, its innovations as well as its challenges and limitations.\nB. Future Prospects and Recommendations for Further Research\nThe topic of Cloud Computing has been widely explored and researched but due to its\nrapidly growing nature, there is always more to be explored.  The first issue I would like to see\naddressed is the lack of longitudinal studies.  Given the relatively young age of cloud services,\nthere are very few longitudinal studies available to show its effects over a long period of time.  In\nthis case, the longitudinal study can view any variable including cost, efficiency, user satisfaction\nand its changes over a set period of time.  I believe scope and diversity in research is also a large\nissue in the cloud computing space.  As cloud computing grows it is becoming more relevant and\napplicable to more companies.  With this being said, research specifically on how it can now\nbenefit companies that aren’t making use of it would allow for a further testament to its\nversatility.  Overall Cloud Computing has proved not only is it here to stay but it is a viable\noption that comes with many benefits for all companies across many different fields.\nC. Final Thoughts on the Importance of Cloud Computing in the Digital Age\nWith the evolution of technology, it is now more than ever important for companies to\ncontinue to plan for the future.  Cloud Computing has proven itself to be more than just a trend\nrather a necessity in the digital age.  It enables organizations of all fields to leverage the power of\nthe internet to deliver flexible, reliable and most importantly scalable solutions.  Scalability is\npossibly the largest benefit to it allowing for companies to easily up or downscale with little to\nno downtime.  This scalability can benefit all sizes of companies as they can utilize their exact\nneeded resources while having options to rapidly expand with their demands.  With the current\ngrowth of cloud computing, it is evident that it will continue to grow and improve allowing it to\nbetter sever a larger quantity and variety of companies and consumers.  It is imperative\n***END OF PAGE 12***\n\n***START OF PAGE 13***\norganizations adopt a strategic approach to migrating and implementing cloud computing as soon\nas possible allowing them to maximize benefits immediately.  By doing so companies will be\nable to reap the benefits of cloud computing and stay ahead of the digital age wave.\nD. REFERENCES\n9 key benefits of cloud computing in Healthcare - Galen Data.
