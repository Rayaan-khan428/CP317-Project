CLOUD COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS
Cloud computing and virtualization are distinct concepts that play crucial roles in modern IT
infrastructure. While virtualization involves creating virtual computing environments
independent of physical infrastructure, cloud computing delivers shared computing resources on
demand through the internet. Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations leverage
technology resources, providing scalable and accessible computing capabilities (VMware n.d.).
Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality, enabling multiple virtual
systems or instances of applications to run on a single server. This consolidation improves
efficiency within organizations and achieves economies of scale. Popular virtualization
technologies include VMware, Hyper-V, and Xen. For instance, a large corporation operating a
data center previously had each server running only one operating system and hosting a specific
application, resulting in underutilization and increased costs. However, by implementing
virtualization, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can run on a single physical server, greatly
reducing the number of servers required and saving costs related to hardware purchases, power
consumption, cooling, and a team to manage it all (VMware n.d.).
Containerization technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, have become widely adopted
in recent years. Unlike traditional virtualization, containerization creates lightweight and isolated
containers that package applications and their dependencies. Containers ensure consistent
behavior across different computing environments and promote scalability, portability, and
reproducibility, making them well-suited for the cloud computing environment. Developers can
streamline application deployment, accelerate software development cycles, and achieve
efficient resource utilization by leveraging containerization technologies. (Kubernetes, n.d.)
Various management tools have also been developed to effectively manage complex cloud
infrastructure. These tools automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications
and services in cloud environments. Kubernetes, for example, provides a platform for
orchestration and management, enabling:
