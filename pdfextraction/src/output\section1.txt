Exploring the Power of Cloud Computing: Innovations and
Challenges
Sebastian Balderrama, Rayaan Khan, Erin Manson, Ryan Mood, and Brandon Pham
ABSTRACT
On premise software storage has imposed its limitations on the software industry for the entirety
of its existence; cloud computing has offered a unique solution to many of those issues and has
completely redefined software storage as we know it. Cloud Computing allows for businesses
and individuals to store work in the cloud, taking up zero physical space and offering a scalable
and secure alternative to on premise storage. The remarkable volume of innovation and the
challenges of software storage will be explored, from cloud computing models, and key players
in modern cloud computing, to current technologies. We will report details on the vast
infrastructure of cloud computing and give background information on all aspects that help aid in
decision making when assessing cloud computing needs. Additionally, technologies such as
VMware, Docker and Kubernetes will be investigated. All of which will help develop the
benefits and drawbacks of cloud computing to better understand practical applications and the
case studies we will discuss. Cloud computing is a major part of the software industry and has
had a lasting impact on how we ensure the worldâ€™s software can run and evolve.
