OVERVIEW
Some of the key characteristics of cloud computing include: being an OnDemand service,
allowing for broad network access, scalability, and heightened security (Novkovic, 2017).
Software available on the cloud can be accessed anywhere network access, making it highly
portable and offering flexibility to those who use it. The security and ability to scale up or down
at a moment’s notice previously discussed, leads into the OnDemand aspect of cloud computing.
Paid services and needs can be altered simultaneously leaving less room for overpaying for
services, which makes cloud computing highly adaptable.
While these characteristics seem to be commonsensical, they were not always the
industry standard. Companies previously had no choice but to have large centers to store their
data. The history of cloud computing is rich in innovation, as consumer needs demanded better
solutions to software storage. Cloud computing can be traced back to as early as 1960 when
Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider worked on a network research project that strived to connect
people and data worldwide (Pedamkar, 2023). In the 1990’s companies started to offer Virtual
Private Network services (VPNs) which remain popular today and truly set the stage for the
cloud computing take over. By 2006 massive tech companies such as Google and Amazon began
using the term cloud computing and made their cloud platforms easily accessible (Regalado,
There are several options for cloud computing models depending on user needs, as well
as providers for these models. Some key players in the cloud computing scene include but are
not limited to: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud platform, Alibaba Cloud,
and Oracle Cloud (Zhang, 2023). A cloud provider may or may not be required for some cloud
computing models. The main four models we will explore in detail will be Public, Private,

Hybrid and Community models. The different models suit a variety of factors which will also be
explored.
