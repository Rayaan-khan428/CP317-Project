INTRODUCTION
Cloud computing as defined by IBM is: “On-demand access, via the internet, to
computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage,
development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed
by a cloud services provider (or CSP)” (IBM, n.d. -a). Cloud computing can be scaled more
easily than on premise storage options and has the ability to lower IT costs by outsourcing
certain efforts related to the development of personalized infrastructure (IBM, n.d. -a).
Speed is a large factor in many businesses' decisions to opt for cloud-based storage
solutions; the speed at which you can scale up or down and integrate software from within the
cloud is remarkable compared to past techniques. Speed is also a major factor in software
development, matching the speed at which competitors release new versions and develop their
equivalent software is of great importance, and utilizing the cloud is one way in which the
software development cycle can be expedited to help ensure a project does not become obsolete
before its release.
A common misconception about cloud computing is that it lacks security when in fact
cloud based computing is likely more secure than in house equivalents. Cloud computing
platforms are designed with great expertise and because high volumes of important information
is stored on the cloud providers recognize the need for thorough security measures. Security
levels can be made highly complex depending on an individual's needs and robust security
measures are wrapped around data within the cloud to maintain security as a top priority
(Alvarez).
