CASE STUDIES AND SUCCESS STORIES
A. Real-World Examples of Organizations Leveraging Cloud Computing
In recent years, Cloud Computing has become an essential tool for businesses across all
industries.  Companies have leveraged cloud computing to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and
increase scalability.  Although there are many examples of companies successfully implementing
cloud computing, we will look at two highly notable examples.
General Electric doesn’t seem to be a company that could benefit from cloud computing
given they are not directly involved in the tech industry.  However, they have done an excellent
job leading the pack by starting its cloud-first application deployment strategy in 2014
(Donnelly, 2017).  Through the use of Amazon Web Service (AWS), they have been able to
refocus IT teams from maintenance and expanding data centers to more meaningful tasks
including future innovation.
Fitbit is the perfect company to use a cloud computing model; with their recent switch to
Google Cloud for Healthcare in 2019, they proved exactly that (Google, 2022).  Given the
business model of Fitbit, they require a large amount of storage space for user health information
and security is a high priority.  This switch to cloud services has allowed for easier scalability,
easy access and shareability for users as well as maintaining its security.
B. Case Studies of Successful Cloud Migrations and Implementations
Cloud migration and implementation vary greatly on a case-to-case basis and ultimately
to be as successful as possible it needs to be tailored to your specific needs.  Now we will view
some specific case studies of how companies were able to design their own cloud migrations to
lead to success.  Acoustic is an excellent example of migrating in a way that fits your company's
needs.
Acoustic is a marketing technology company that wanted to make the switch to a cloud-
based model through Amazon Web Service (AWS) but did not want to renew their current
contract meaning they were left with a 10-month window (Boezeman, n.d.).  With the help of
ClearScale, they were able to not only transfer everything over to the cloud in this time frame but
reap massive benefits.  This switch allowed Acoustic to save millions of dollars, modernize and
optimize its infrastructure as well as allow for faster process time to market.

A second large company that was able to benefit from the switch to Cloud Computing
greatly is Pandora.  Pandora is a worldwide industry-leading jewelry company with unique
requirements.  Given the large cost of jewelry, a company like Pandora will endure large
quantities of customers with few purchases per customer.  This means that customers will grow
to have high expectations as it is a large and meaningful transaction.  In 14 months, they were
able to decommission 2400 servers and make the full switch to Microsoft Azure’s Cloud service
(Accenture, 2023).  This switch allowed for a massive save in cost, and an increase in simplicity
allowing for easier and quicker IT decisions as well as increased agility for consumers.
