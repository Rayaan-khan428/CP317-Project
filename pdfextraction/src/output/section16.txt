Medical imaging and diagnostic: cloud-based medical imaging platforms store and
process large volumes of medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. Cloud
computing enables healthcare providers to share access to medical images securely,
facilitating collaboration among radiologists and specials for accurate diagnoses and
treatment planning (Galen Data, n.d.).
Lastly, cloud computing has a profound impact on the government and public sector, helping
to save tax-payer money and improve the services offered by the government.
