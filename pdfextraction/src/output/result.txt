Challenges
Sebastian Balderrama, Rayaan Khan, Erin Manson, Ryan Mood, and Brandon Pham
ABSTRACT
On premise software storage has imposed its limitations on the software industry for the entirety
of its existence; cloud computing has offered a unique solution to many of those issues and has
completely redefined software storage as we know it. Cloud Computing allows for businesses
and individuals to store work in the cloud, taking up zero physical space and offering a scalable
and secure alternative to on premise storage. The remarkable volume of innovation and the
challenges of software storage will be explored, from cloud computing models, and key players
in modern cloud computing, to current technologies. We will report details on the vast
infrastructure of cloud computing and give background information on all aspects that help aid in
decision making when assessing cloud computing needs. Additionally, technologies such as
VMware, Docker and Kubernetes will be investigated. All of which will help develop the
benefits and drawbacks of cloud computing to better understand practical applications and the
case studies we will discuss. Cloud computing is a major part of the software industry and has
had a lasting impact on how we ensure the world’s software can run and evolve.

1. INTRODUCTION
Cloud computing as defined by IBM is: “On-demand access, via the internet, to
computing resources—applications, servers (physical servers and virtual servers), data storage,
development tools, networking capabilities, and more—hosted at a remote data center managed
by a cloud services provider (or CSP)” (IBM, n.d. -a). Cloud computing can be scaled more
easily than on premise storage options and has the ability to lower IT costs by outsourcing
certain efforts related to the development of personalized infrastructure (IBM, n.d. -a).
Speed is a large factor in many businesses' decisions to opt for cloud-based storage
solutions; the speed at which you can scale up or down and integrate software from within the
cloud is remarkable compared to past techniques. Speed is also a major factor in software
development, matching the speed at which competitors release new versions and develop their
equivalent software is of great importance, and utilizing the cloud is one way in which the
software development cycle can be expedited to help ensure a project does not become obsolete
before its release.
A common misconception about cloud computing is that it lacks security when in fact
cloud based computing is likely more secure than in house equivalents. Cloud computing
platforms are designed with great expertise and because high volumes of important information
is stored on the cloud providers recognize the need for thorough security measures. Security
levels can be made highly complex depending on an individual's needs and robust security
measures are wrapped around data within the cloud to maintain security as a top priority
(Alvarez).
2. OVERVIEW
Some of the key characteristics of cloud computing include: being an OnDemand service,
allowing for broad network access, scalability, and heightened security (Novkovic, 2017).
Software available on the cloud can be accessed anywhere network access, making it highly
portable and offering flexibility to those who use it. The security and ability to scale up or down
at a moment’s notice previously discussed, leads into the OnDemand aspect of cloud computing.
Paid services and needs can be altered simultaneously leaving less room for overpaying for
services, which makes cloud computing highly adaptable.
While these characteristics seem to be commonsensical, they were not always the
industry standard. Companies previously had no choice but to have large centers to store their
data. The history of cloud computing is rich in innovation, as consumer needs demanded better
solutions to software storage. Cloud computing can be traced back to as early as 1960 when
Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider worked on a network research project that strived to connect
people and data worldwide (Pedamkar, 2023). In the 1990’s companies started to offer Virtual
Private Network services (VPNs) which remain popular today and truly set the stage for the
cloud computing take over. By 2006 massive tech companies such as Google and Amazon began
using the term cloud computing and made their cloud platforms easily accessible (Regalado,
There are several options for cloud computing models depending on user needs, as well
as providers for these models. Some key players in the cloud computing scene include but are
not limited to: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google cloud platform, Alibaba Cloud,
and Oracle Cloud (Zhang, 2023). A cloud provider may or may not be required for some cloud
computing models. The main four models we will explore in detail will be Public, Private,
***END OF PAGE 2***

***START OF PAGE 3***
Hybrid and Community models. The different models suit a variety of factors which will also be
explored.
3. CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS
Cloud deployment models play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of modern
computing. As organizations increasingly embrace cloud computing, understanding the various
deployment models becomes essential for making informed decisions about resource allocation,
security, and scalability.
The four primary cloud deployment models are public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud,
and community cloud. Each cloud deployment model has its advantages and considerations, and
the choice depends on factors such as data sensitivity, compliance requirements, scalability
needs, budget, and organizational preferences. Many organizations opt for a multi-cloud
approach, combining different deployment models to create a customized and optimal cloud
environment.
A. Public Cloud:
The public cloud is a cloud computing model that enables widespread accessibility to
systems and services. It is available to the general public and major industry groups, but it may
be perceived as less secure due to its openness. In this model, cloud infrastructure services are
delivered over the internet by third-party providers, and the infrastructure is owned by the
service provider rather than the consumer. Public cloud hosting allows for easy access to systems
and services. Providers offer storage backup, retrieval services, and more either for free, through
subscription models, or based on the number of users.
Prominent public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft
Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This cloud model emphasizes scalability, cost-
effectiveness, and user-friendly payment structures where users pay for the resources they utilize
on a pay-as-you-go basis, while sacrificing guaranteed high-level security and customizability
(GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c)
B. Private Cloud:
The private cloud deployment model stands in direct contrast to the public cloud
deployment model, as it creates an exclusive environment for a single user or customer. In the
private cloud, there is no need to share hardware resources with other users. It grants access to
systems and services within a specific organization or defined boundary. This cloud platform is
implemented in a secure environment protected by robust firewalls and managed by the
organization's IT department.
The private cloud provides enhanced control over cloud resources, allowing organizations
to exercise greater flexibility and customization. It offers similar advantages to the public cloud,
such as scalability and self-service capabilities, but with the added benefits of increased security
and tailored management (GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c). Private clouds can be hosted either on-
premises within an organization's data center or by a trusted third-party provider, catering to the
specific needs of organizations with regulatory requirements or sensitive data.
The drawbacks include limited scalability due to a smaller number of clients and higher
costs resulting from the provision of personalized facilities.
C. Hybrid Cloud:
***END OF PAGE 3***

***START OF PAGE 4***
Hybrid cloud computing combines the best of both public and private cloud worlds by
utilizing proprietary software to bridge the two. This approach allows organizations to host their
applications in a secure environment while also benefiting from the cost savings offered by the
public cloud. By employing a combination of multiple cloud deployment methods, organizations
can seamlessly transfer data and applications between different clouds based on their specific
requirements.
The hybrid cloud model offers advantages such as flexibility and control, allowing
businesses to tailor solutions to their specific needs. It also provides cost savings since scalability
in public clouds means paying only for additional capacity when required. However, managing
hybrid clouds can be challenging due to the complexity of combining public and private clouds.
Data transmission in the hybrid cloud occurs through the public cloud, leading to potential
latency issues (GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c).
D. Community Cloud:
The community cloud is a distributed system that allows a group of organizations to
access systems and services tailored to their specific needs. It involves integrating the services of
different clouds to create an infrastructure shared among organizations within a community,
industry, or business. This shared infrastructure is typically managed either by a third-party
provider or by a combination of organizations within the community.
Community clouds are designed to meet the requirements of specific communities, such
as government agencies, research institutions, or industry consortiums. By sharing costs,
resources, and infrastructure, community members maintain control over their own data and
applications while benefiting from collaboration opportunities, resource pooling, and specialized
services that cater to their unique needs.
Some disadvantages include limited scalability due to resource sharing among
organizations based on collaborative interests and restrictions on customization, as modifications
by one organization can impact others sharing the same data and resources (GeeksForGeeks, n.d.
-c).
4. ARCHITECHTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE OF CLOUD
COMPUTING
The architecture and infrastructure of cloud computing are designed to provide scalable,
flexible, and cost-effective solutions for businesses and individuals. To support these goals, cloud
computing offers different service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform
as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
A. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can access and
manage virtual machines, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources from a
cloud service provider (CSP). It offers a high level of flexibility and control, allowing users to
scale their infrastructure up or down based on their individual/organizational needs.
The responsibility for managing and maintaining the infrastructure lies with the CSP,
allowing you to focus on tasks such as software installation, configuration, and management, as
well as ensuring the security of your data (Google, n.d. -c).
B. Platform as a Service (PaaS):
***END OF PAGE 4***

***START OF PAGE 5***
PaaS provides a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications. Similar to
IaaS models, in PaaS, the service provider takes care of delivering and managing the underlying
infrastructure. While you are responsible for coding, handling data, and managing your
applications, the burden of managing and maintaining the platform itself is alleviated.
PaaS solutions are specific to application and software development and typically include:
• Cloud infrastructure: Data centers, storage, network equipment, and servers
• Middleware software: Operating systems, frameworks, development kits (SDK),
libraries, and more
• User interface: A graphical user interface (GUI), a command line interface (CLI), an API
interface, and in some cases, all three (Google, n.d. -e).
C. Software as a Service (SaaS):
Through SaaS, software applications are hosted and delivered over the internet. Users can
access and use software applications without the need for local installation or management which
provides convenience, accessibility, and comes with automatic software updates. Some key
features of SaaS include:
• Application Accessibility: SaaS applications are accessible through web browsers or
dedicated client applications, allowing users to access them from various devices and
locations.
• Multi-Tenancy: SaaS applications support multiple users or organizations sharing the
same software instance while maintaining data separation and security.
• Subscription-based Model: SaaS typically operates on a subscription-based pricing
model, where users pay for the software on a recurring basis (SalesForce, n.d.).
D. Virtualization and its role in cloud computing:
Virtualization plays a fundamental role in enabling the service models of previously
mentioned above. Through virtualization, the cloud service provider can efficiently allocate and
manage resources, dynamically scale up or down based on demand, and ensure the isolation and
security of user environments. It is the foundation that enables the scalability, flexibility, and
agility that cloud computing is known for (AWS, n.d.).
Virtualization uses specialized software, called a hypervisor, to create several cloud
instances or virtual machines on one physical computer. From the user’s perspective, the virtual
machine operates like a typical server. CPUs, Random Access Memory (RAM), and storage
appear the same as on a physical server. You can also configure and update the guest operating
systems and their applications as necessary without affecting the host operating system (AWS,
n.d.).
The hypervisor is installed on the physical machine, serving as a mediator between the
virtual machines and the underlying hardware or host operating system. It operates as a software
layer that facilitates the allocation of physical resources to multiple virtual machines. By
coordinating access to the physical environment, the hypervisor ensures that each virtual
machine has its dedicated portion of resources.
For example, if the virtual machine requires computing resources, such as computer
processing power, the request first goes to the hypervisor. The hypervisor then passes the request
to the underlying hardware, which performs the task (AWS, n.d.).
The following are the two main types of hypervisors.
***END OF PAGE 5***

***START OF PAGE 6***
• Type 1 hypervisors: Also called a bare-metal hypervisor, runs directly on the computer
hardware and interacts directly with the physical resources.
• Type 2 hypervisors: Runs as an application on computer hardware with an existing
operating system. This type of hypervisor is used when running multiple operating
systems on a single machine.
5. BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
A. Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing has various functionalities and attributes which make it advantageous,
providing numerous benefits.
One of the major benefits of cloud computing is the fact that it provides scalability.
Scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability of cloud computing to scale the amount of
resources required for each individual use case, allowing for the demands of services to be met
without the need to invest in physical infrastructures (Google, n.d.-a). This means that businesses
which require the use of things such as data storage and databases are able to scale the amount of
storage they need in a seamless manner.
Cost-efficiency is an element of cloud computing that is beneficial due to the fact that
cloud services provide users with the ability to reduce their investments into physical hardware,
and to only invest into the cloud services which they specifically need (Google, n.d.-a). This
allows for business to be more cost efficient, as only resources which are used are provided to
the end user (Google, n.d.-a).
B. Security and Privacy Concerns
Privacy and security have been major concerns when regarding the use of cloud
computing, with various reasons as to why these concerns may exist. The cloud is susceptible to
attacks, which can result in the loss of personal data, which is why security and privacy are of
high importance when regarding the use of the cloud.
The confidentiality of data may be compromised during the use of cloud computer
software. Instances of data theft during a targeted attack may result in a user’s personal data
being stolen, resulting in a privacy breach between the user and the provider of the cloud service
(GeeksforGeeks, 2023a). The occurrence of a privacy breach can result in the mistrust of a user
for a particular cloud service, and the data of the user to be reachable by users who should not
have authorization (GeeksforGeeks, 2023a).
Security issues can occur through the use of multi-tenancy for the cloud operation. Multi-
tenancy is the use of software systems in such a way where the services used by multiple users
are all accessed on a single server, resulting in more cost-effective, but less secure operation
(GeeksforGeeks, 2023a). This can result in security concerns, as it allows for attackers to gain
access to multiple tenants' data if they are to gain access to the one server (GeeksforGeeks,
C. Reliability and Availability Issues
The reliability and availability issues for cloud computing span to problems which can
affect a wide range of people. In the context of cloud computing, reliability refers to how often
failures occur, and availability refers to the downtime of the cloud service (Ooteghem, 2022).
Issues in reliability can occur when cloud services are not accessible, when there are frequent
***END OF PAGE 6***

***START OF PAGE 7***
interruptions during use, and if the cloud service is not secure (Ooteghem, 2022). Availability
issues occur when the cloud services are suffering from service outages, resulting in the
unavailability of the service to be accessed by users. The lack of availability of a cloud service
could impact millions of people, as many cloud services are used worldwide on a daily basis,
affecting average citizens, businesses, or government entities.
D. Legal and Regulatory Challenges
Cloud computing can face challenges in the aspects of legality and regulation. Due to the
nature of cloud computing requiring the transferring and storing of data, the aspect of privacy
concerns rise. The European Union created the 1995 Data Protection Directive in order to ensure
the protection of personal data and the transfer of such data, resulting in the transfer of user data
through international to only be permitted by US businesses granted permission (Khatri, 2022).
The hosting of cloud computer services and the use of its data has resulted in many regulations
being put in place, which could result in these cloud services requiring a higher cost by the end
user in order to comply with the regulations which were put in place (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).
6. CLOUD COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS
Cloud computing and virtualization are distinct concepts that play crucial roles in modern IT
infrastructure. While virtualization involves creating virtual computing environments
independent of physical infrastructure, cloud computing delivers shared computing resources on
demand through the internet. Cloud computing has revolutionized how organizations leverage
technology resources, providing scalable and accessible computing capabilities (VMware n.d.).
Virtualization relies on software to simulate hardware functionality, enabling multiple virtual
systems or instances of applications to run on a single server. This consolidation improves
efficiency within organizations and achieves economies of scale. Popular virtualization
technologies include VMware, Hyper-V, and Xen. For instance, a large corporation operating a
data center previously had each server running only one operating system and hosting a specific
application, resulting in underutilization and increased costs. However, by implementing
virtualization, multiple virtual machines (VMs) can run on a single physical server, greatly
reducing the number of servers required and saving costs related to hardware purchases, power
consumption, cooling, and a team to manage it all (VMware n.d.).
Containerization technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes, have become widely adopted
in recent years. Unlike traditional virtualization, containerization creates lightweight and isolated
containers that package applications and their dependencies. Containers ensure consistent
behavior across different computing environments and promote scalability, portability, and
reproducibility, making them well-suited for the cloud computing environment. Developers can
streamline application deployment, accelerate software development cycles, and achieve
efficient resource utilization by leveraging containerization technologies. (Kubernetes, n.d.)
Various management tools have also been developed to effectively manage complex cloud
infrastructure. These tools automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications
and services in cloud environments. Kubernetes, for example, provides a platform for
orchestration and management, enabling:
***END OF PAGE 7***

***START OF PAGE 8***
1. automated scaling: increase and decrease the number of nodes to meet the incoming
demand or lack of at any given time.
2. load balancing: process of distributing network traffic efficiently among back-end
services.
3. self-healing capabilities: in the event a container fails Kubernetes can automatically
redeploy the container to its desired state to restore operations.
Cloud providers also offer their own orchestration and management tools, such as Amazon
Elastic Kubernetes Service or Google Kubernetes Engine.
Cloud storage and databases are critical components of cloud computing, allowing
organizations to store vast amounts of data and access it from anywhere in the world. Industry-
leading cloud storage options include Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon S3,
providing secure and reliable storage for different types of data. These cloud databases eliminate
the need for organizations to maintain and manage their own database infrastructure. By
leveraging cloud storage and databases, businesses can scale their storage and database needs on
demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. (DBMastero, n.d.)
Cloud computing and virtualization are distinct yet interconnected technologies that have
revolutionized the IT landscape. Cloud computing offers scalable and on-demand access to
computing resources, while virtualization enables efficient resource utilization within
organizations. Containerization technologies, management tools like Kubernetes, and reliable
cloud storage and databases further enhance the capabilities of cloud computing, empowering
businesses to leverage technology resources effectively and achieve their goals.
7. CLOUD COMPUTING USE CASES AND APPLICATIONS
When it comes to business and enterprises, cloud computing offers great leaps in scalable
and on-demand access to computing resources, cost savings and increased efficiency as spoken
about in the previous section. However, we will explore some specific use cases/applications.
1. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): cloud provides virtualized infrastructure resources such
as virtual machines, storage, and networking capabilities. This allows businesses to
offload the management and maintenance of hardware infrastructure, reducing costs and
enabling rapid scalability.
2. Software as a Service (SaaS): Cloud-based software applications provide businesses with
easy access to a wide range of productivity tools, customer relationship management
systems and enterprise resource planning solutions. An example of a SaaS Company is
Slack, a cloud-based messaging service geared towards professionals.
3. Big Data analytics: In today's world many of the decisions a company makes are driven
by data. But to leverage data it requires an extreme amount of hardware. By utilizing
cloud-based analytics platforms organizations can make better decisions for the company
without having to invest potentially millions in hardware and an in-house team.
Cloud computing has also permanently changed the way students learn in the 21st century.
Cloud-based learning management systems (LMS) and virtual classrooms has provided students
the ability to access course materials, participate in class, and submit assignments from
anywhere. It has also enabled people in developing countries to get a good level of education,
***END OF PAGE 8***

***START OF PAGE 9***
through websites like khan academy or universities own courses that are often free online like
the infamous Harvard CS50 course (Cloud Academy, n.d.).
Cloud computing in healthcare plays a vital role in helping patients in a very productive way.
It has transformed the way patient data is stored, shared, and analyzed. Some key applications of
cloud computing in healthcare include:
1. Electronic Health Records (EHR): storing information on the cloud about patients makes
it accessible for different healthcare professionals, helping to ensure a seamless data
exchange, helping to improve coordination among departments and effectively reducing
the risk of medical errors occurring.
2. Medical imaging and diagnostic: cloud-based medical imaging platforms store and
process large volumes of medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. Cloud
computing enables healthcare providers to share access to medical images securely,
facilitating collaboration among radiologists and specials for accurate diagnoses and
treatment planning (Galen Data, n.d.).
Lastly, cloud computing has a profound impact on the government and public sector, helping
to save tax-payer money and improve the services offered by the government.
1. E-Government Services have enabled citizens to access government services and
information online. This includes online tax filing, permit applications, and voter
registration. It allows all this to be done from home reducing the load on government
offices that can now serve people who have needs that cannot be completed online.
2. Government data storage and sharing has been another sector that has been
revolutionized due to cloud computing, companies like Amazon work with the US
Government to ensure that the records of citizens is safely kept, as well as sense military
info that would originally be transferable only by physical means across the country can
now be accessed anywhere securely (GovOS, 2022).
Cloud computing offers a wide range of use cases and applications across various sectors. In
business and enterprises, cloud computing provides scalable infrastructure, software services,
data storage, and analytics capabilities. In education, cloud computing enables online learning,
collaboration, and virtual lab environments. In healthcare, cloud computing facilitates secure
patient data management, telemedicine, and medical imaging. In the government and public
sector, cloud computing supports data storage, e-government services, collaboration, and
emergency response. As technology advances and organizations continue to embrace the benefits
of cloud computing, its impact will undoubtedly expand, further revolutionizing industries and
improving services in the digital age.
8. FUTURE TRENDS AND CHALLENGES
A. Edge Computing and its Impact on Cloud Computing
Edge computing is the processing of data as close to the origin source as possible in order
to reduce latency and provide better bandwidth. The data being processed closer to the creation
point allows for faster data analysis and lower latencies, resulting in a better user experience
(IBM, n.d.-b).
The differences between edge computing and cloud computing is that edge computing
operates on a time sensitive basis, whereas cloud computing does not, meaning data processed
***END OF PAGE 9***

***START OF PAGE 10***
through edge computing is processed at a lower signal latency (Arora, 2023). In cloud
computing, data is stored and processed in centralized servers, allowing for higher processing
power (Kaur, 2023). On the other hand, the infrastructure for edge computing is highly
distributed, and typically processed on site at a low processing power (Kaur, 2023). Cloud
computing allows for unlimited storage, reduced hardware costs and quick centralized services,
while edge computing provides lower latency, better bandwidth, real-time computation, and
better privacy (Kaur, 2023).
There are challenges to both edge computing and cloud computing. Edge computing may
suffer from reliability issues due to its decentralized nature, compatibility issues, and security
issues for data that is processed outside of the edge servers (Kaur, 2023). Cloud computing may
suffer from large data breaches/data losses due to the information being centralized, long
downtimes, and a lack of data confidentiality (Kaur, 2023).
Cloud computing can be seen used in applications such as an app on a smartphone, where
edge computing can be seen used in things such as self-driving cars, where a reduced latency and
fast response times are required (Kaur, 2023).
B. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in the Cloud
Artificial intelligence and machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, are used in
cloud computing in order to teach systems to solve tasks while improving on the solving of these
tasks over time through the processing of data (Google, n.d.-d).
Through the use of data, machine learning processes the data, identifying common
patterns within the data and making decisions based off of these identified patterns (Google, n.d.-
d). It allows for systems to learn a program’s tendencies and effectively achieves what is to be
achieved over time.
Machine learning is used in a variety of ways, including in services such as fraud
prevention, digital marketing, security, customer service and sales optimization (Google, n.d.-d).
C. Serverless computing and Function as a Service (FaaS)
Serverless computing is the ability to create applications without the need of the creation
of infrastructure, allowing for cloud services to be the primary infrastructure used to process the
code (Serverless Computing and Applications | Microsoft Azure, n.d.). Benefits of serverless
computing include efficient allocation of resources, scalability, quicker services, and the lack of
need to maintain infrastructure (Serverless Computing and Applications | Microsoft Azure, n.d.).
Through serverless computing, developers are able to focus on developing front-end code, while
the back-end code is managed by the provider of the cloud service (IBM, n.d.-d).
Technologies such as serverless Kubernetes allow for systems that have developers
provide containers to a platform which is orchestrated in a manner where it is automatically
scaled when met with spikes and dips in demand (Serverless Computing and Applications |
Microsoft Azure, n.d.).
Function as a Service (FaaS) is a service of cloud computing which lets users execute
code without managing the infrastructure required for these services (IBM, n.d.-c). The
difference between serverless computing and Function as a Service is the fact that Function as a
Service is a subset of serverless computing (IBM, n.d.-c). FaaS focuses on the execution of code
in response to an event, while serverless computing is broader and multi-faceted, focusing on
things such as storage, databases, APIs, computation, or messaging services that are not visible to
the end user (IBM, n.d.-c).
***END OF PAGE 10***

***START OF PAGE 11***
D. Sustainability and Green Cloud Computing
Sustainability in cloud computing, otherwise known as green cloud computing, is a term
used in reference to the environmental impacts in regard to cloud computing. Green cloud
computing is a set of goals put in place which aim to reduce carbon emissions and energy
consumption by promoting the increase of biodegradable/recyclable products, reducing the use
of unsafe materials, and increasing energy efficiency (Davis, 2023).
The goals of green cloud computing are strived to be achieved through a variety of
factors. The components which are found in electronics such as computers and phones contain
materials which are hazardous to the environment; This makes it essential to dispose of
electronics properly, and to increase the recyclability/biodegradability of future products.
Energy efficiency can be increased through the optimization of the facilities which hold
the cloud servers, and the optimization of the infrastructure (Davis, 2023). The facilities are often
planned in a manner where the location, architecture, and layout of the building are created in
such a way to be the most energy efficient as possible in order to reduce the heat of the servers,
going to extents such as to be built underground or in the ocean (Davis, 2023).
9. CASE STUDIES AND SUCCESS STORIES
A. Real-World Examples of Organizations Leveraging Cloud Computing
In recent years, Cloud Computing has become an essential tool for businesses across all
industries.  Companies have leveraged cloud computing to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and
increase scalability.  Although there are many examples of companies successfully implementing
cloud computing, we will look at two highly notable examples.
General Electric doesn’t seem to be a company that could benefit from cloud computing
given they are not directly involved in the tech industry.  However, they have done an excellent
job leading the pack by starting its cloud-first application deployment strategy in 2014
(Donnelly, 2017).  Through the use of Amazon Web Service (AWS), they have been able to
refocus IT teams from maintenance and expanding data centers to more meaningful tasks
including future innovation.
Fitbit is the perfect company to use a cloud computing model; with their recent switch to
Google Cloud for Healthcare in 2019, they proved exactly that (Google, 2022).  Given the
business model of Fitbit, they require a large amount of storage space for user health information
and security is a high priority.  This switch to cloud services has allowed for easier scalability,
easy access and shareability for users as well as maintaining its security.
B. Case Studies of Successful Cloud Migrations and Implementations
Cloud migration and implementation vary greatly on a case-to-case basis and ultimately
to be as successful as possible it needs to be tailored to your specific needs.  Now we will view
some specific case studies of how companies were able to design their own cloud migrations to
lead to success.  Acoustic is an excellent example of migrating in a way that fits your company's
needs.
Acoustic is a marketing technology company that wanted to make the switch to a cloud-
based model through Amazon Web Service (AWS) but did not want to renew their current
contract meaning they were left with a 10-month window (Boezeman, n.d.).  With the help of
ClearScale, they were able to not only transfer everything over to the cloud in this time frame but
reap massive benefits.  This switch allowed Acoustic to save millions of dollars, modernize and
optimize its infrastructure as well as allow for faster process time to market.
***END OF PAGE 11***

***START OF PAGE 12***
A second large company that was able to benefit from the switch to Cloud Computing
greatly is Pandora.  Pandora is a worldwide industry-leading jewelry company with unique
requirements.  Given the large cost of jewelry, a company like Pandora will endure large
quantities of customers with few purchases per customer.  This means that customers will grow
to have high expectations as it is a large and meaningful transaction.  In 14 months, they were
able to decommission 2400 servers and make the full switch to Microsoft Azure’s Cloud service
(Accenture, 2023).  This switch allowed for a massive save in cost, and an increase in simplicity
allowing for easier and quicker IT decisions as well as increased agility for consumers.
10. CONCLUSION
A. Summary of Key Findings and Insights
Cloud Computing has forever revolutionized and transformed the way companies and
users store, access, process and deliver information and services.  It offers a long list of benefits
dependent on the specific use case but scalability, cost efficiency and flexibility are massive
benefits for everyone.  However, that is not to say that it comes without its own challenges
including security, reliability, legal/regulatory constraints and potential privacy issues when
handling sensitive data.  In this paper, we have explored cloud deployment models, architecture,
infrastructure, benefits, limitations and current technology and tools.  We were also able to apply
this to the real world through case studies and examples of companies that have greatly benefited
from implementing a cloud computing model.  In the course of this paper, we hope to have
contributed to the understanding and appreciation of cloud computing by exploring the power of
cloud computing, its innovations as well as its challenges and limitations.
B. Future Prospects and Recommendations for Further Research
The topic of Cloud Computing has been widely explored and researched but due to its
rapidly growing nature, there is always more to be explored.  The first issue I would like to see
addressed is the lack of longitudinal studies.  Given the relatively young age of cloud services,
there are very few longitudinal studies available to show its effects over a long period of time.  In
this case, the longitudinal study can view any variable including cost, efficiency, user satisfaction
and its changes over a set period of time.  I believe scope and diversity in research is also a large
issue in the cloud computing space.  As cloud computing grows it is becoming more relevant and
applicable to more companies.  With this being said, research specifically on how it can now
benefit companies that aren’t making use of it would allow for a further testament to its
versatility.  Overall Cloud Computing has proved not only is it here to stay but it is a viable
option that comes with many benefits for all companies across many different fields.
C. Final Thoughts on the Importance of Cloud Computing in the Digital Age
With the evolution of technology, it is now more than ever important for companies to
continue to plan for the future.  Cloud Computing has proven itself to be more than just a trend
rather a necessity in the digital age.  It enables organizations of all fields to leverage the power of
the internet to deliver flexible, reliable and most importantly scalable solutions.  Scalability is
possibly the largest benefit to it allowing for companies to easily up or downscale with little to
no downtime.  This scalability can benefit all sizes of companies as they can utilize their exact
needed resources while having options to rapidly expand with their demands.  With the current
growth of cloud computing, it is evident that it will continue to grow and improve allowing it to
better sever a larger quantity and variety of companies and consumers.  It is imperative

organizations adopt a strategic approach to migrating and implementing cloud computing as soon
as possible allowing them to maximize benefits immediately.  By doing so companies will be
able to reap the benefits of cloud computing and stay ahead of the digital age wave.
