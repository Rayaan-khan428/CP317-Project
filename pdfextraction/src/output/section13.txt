1 Green Iguana (Iguana iguana)
The Green Iguana (Iguana iguana) is a fascinating lizard species found predominantly in Central
and South America, known for its vibrant
green coloration and impressive size.  With
an average length of 1.5 to 1.8 meters,
including the tail, it is one of the largest
lizard species in its range. The Green Iguana
is primarily arboreal, spending much of its
time in the treetops to avoid predators and
search for its herbivorous diet, consisting of
leaves, flowers, and fruits. This adaptable
reptile has also managed to colonize urban
areas, where it can be seen basking in the
sun on fences or tree branches. Despite its
popularity in the pet trade, the Green
Iguana faces conservation concerns due to
habitat loss and poaching. Understanding the ecological significance of this species and
promoting responsible pet ownership are crucial steps in safeguarding the future of the Green
Iguana and its vital role in the ecosystems it inhabits.
