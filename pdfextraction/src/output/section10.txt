self-healing capabilities: in the event a container fails Kubernetes can automatically
redeploy the container to its desired state to restore operations.
Cloud providers also offer their own orchestration and management tools, such as Amazon
Elastic Kubernetes Service or Google Kubernetes Engine.
Cloud storage and databases are critical components of cloud computing, allowing
organizations to store vast amounts of data and access it from anywhere in the world. Industry-
leading cloud storage options include Google Cloud Storage, Microsoft Azure, and Amazon S3,
providing secure and reliable storage for different types of data. These cloud databases eliminate
the need for organizations to maintain and manage their own database infrastructure. By
leveraging cloud storage and databases, businesses can scale their storage and database needs on
demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost-efficiency. (DBMastero, n.d.)
Cloud computing and virtualization are distinct yet interconnected technologies that have
revolutionized the IT landscape. Cloud computing offers scalable and on-demand access to
computing resources, while virtualization enables efficient resource utilization within
organizations. Containerization technologies, management tools like Kubernetes, and reliable
cloud storage and databases further enhance the capabilities of cloud computing, empowering
businesses to leverage technology resources effectively and achieve their goals.
