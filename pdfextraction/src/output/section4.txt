CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS
Cloud deployment models play a crucial role in shaping the landscape of modern
computing. As organizations increasingly embrace cloud computing, understanding the various
deployment models becomes essential for making informed decisions about resource allocation,
security, and scalability.
The four primary cloud deployment models are public cloud, private cloud, hybrid cloud,
and community cloud. Each cloud deployment model has its advantages and considerations, and
the choice depends on factors such as data sensitivity, compliance requirements, scalability
needs, budget, and organizational preferences. Many organizations opt for a multi-cloud
approach, combining different deployment models to create a customized and optimal cloud
environment.
A. Public Cloud:
The public cloud is a cloud computing model that enables widespread accessibility to
systems and services. It is available to the general public and major industry groups, but it may
be perceived as less secure due to its openness. In this model, cloud infrastructure services are
delivered over the internet by third-party providers, and the infrastructure is owned by the
service provider rather than the consumer. Public cloud hosting allows for easy access to systems
and services. Providers offer storage backup, retrieval services, and more either for free, through
subscription models, or based on the number of users.
Prominent public cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft
Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). This cloud model emphasizes scalability, cost-
effectiveness, and user-friendly payment structures where users pay for the resources they utilize
on a pay-as-you-go basis, while sacrificing guaranteed high-level security and customizability

B. Private Cloud:
The private cloud deployment model stands in direct contrast to the public cloud
deployment model, as it creates an exclusive environment for a single user or customer. In the
private cloud, there is no need to share hardware resources with other users. It grants access to
systems and services within a specific organization or defined boundary. This cloud platform is
implemented in a secure environment protected by robust firewalls and managed by the
organization's IT department.
The private cloud provides enhanced control over cloud resources, allowing organizations
to exercise greater flexibility and customization. It offers similar advantages to the public cloud,
such as scalability and self-service capabilities, but with the added benefits of increased security
and tailored management (GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c). Private clouds can be hosted either on-
premises within an organization's data center or by a trusted third-party provider, catering to the
specific needs of organizations with regulatory requirements or sensitive data.
The drawbacks include limited scalability due to a smaller number of clients and higher
costs resulting from the provision of personalized facilities.
C. Hybrid Cloud:

Hybrid cloud computing combines the best of both public and private cloud worlds by
utilizing proprietary software to bridge the two. This approach allows organizations to host their
applications in a secure environment while also benefiting from the cost savings offered by the
public cloud. By employing a combination of multiple cloud deployment methods, organizations
can seamlessly transfer data and applications between different clouds based on their specific
requirements.
The hybrid cloud model offers advantages such as flexibility and control, allowing
businesses to tailor solutions to their specific needs. It also provides cost savings since scalability
in public clouds means paying only for additional capacity when required. However, managing
hybrid clouds can be challenging due to the complexity of combining public and private clouds.
Data transmission in the hybrid cloud occurs through the public cloud, leading to potential
latency issues (GeeksForGeeks, n.d. -c).
D. Community Cloud:
The community cloud is a distributed system that allows a group of organizations to
access systems and services tailored to their specific needs. It involves integrating the services of
different clouds to create an infrastructure shared among organizations within a community,
industry, or business. This shared infrastructure is typically managed either by a third-party
provider or by a combination of organizations within the community.
Community clouds are designed to meet the requirements of specific communities, such
as government agencies, research institutions, or industry consortiums. By sharing costs,
resources, and infrastructure, community members maintain control over their own data and
applications while benefiting from collaboration opportunities, resource pooling, and specialized
services that cater to their unique needs.
Some disadvantages include limited scalability due to resource sharing among
organizations based on collaborative interests and restrictions on customization, as modifications
by one organization can impact others sharing the same data and resources (GeeksForGeeks, n.d.
