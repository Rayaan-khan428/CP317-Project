BENEFITS AND CHALLENGES OF CLOUD COMPUTING
A. Benefits of Cloud Computing
Cloud computing has various functionalities and attributes which make it advantageous,
providing numerous benefits.
One of the major benefits of cloud computing is the fact that it provides scalability.
Scalability in cloud computing refers to the ability of cloud computing to scale the amount of
resources required for each individual use case, allowing for the demands of services to be met
without the need to invest in physical infrastructures (Google, n.d.-a). This means that businesses
which require the use of things such as data storage and databases are able to scale the amount of
storage they need in a seamless manner.
Cost-efficiency is an element of cloud computing that is beneficial due to the fact that
cloud services provide users with the ability to reduce their investments into physical hardware,
and to only invest into the cloud services which they specifically need (Google, n.d.-a). This
allows for business to be more cost efficient, as only resources which are used are provided to
the end user (Google, n.d.-a).
B. Security and Privacy Concerns
Privacy and security have been major concerns when regarding the use of cloud
computing, with various reasons as to why these concerns may exist. The cloud is susceptible to
attacks, which can result in the loss of personal data, which is why security and privacy are of
high importance when regarding the use of the cloud.
The confidentiality of data may be compromised during the use of cloud computer
software. Instances of data theft during a targeted attack may result in a userâ€™s personal data
being stolen, resulting in a privacy breach between the user and the provider of the cloud service
(GeeksforGeeks, 2023a). The occurrence of a privacy breach can result in the mistrust of a user
for a particular cloud service, and the data of the user to be reachable by users who should not
have authorization (GeeksforGeeks, 2023a).
Security issues can occur through the use of multi-tenancy for the cloud operation. Multi-
tenancy is the use of software systems in such a way where the services used by multiple users
are all accessed on a single server, resulting in more cost-effective, but less secure operation
(GeeksforGeeks, 2023a). This can result in security concerns, as it allows for attackers to gain
access to multiple tenants' data if they are to gain access to the one server (GeeksforGeeks,
C. Reliability and Availability Issues
The reliability and availability issues for cloud computing span to problems which can
affect a wide range of people. In the context of cloud computing, reliability refers to how often
failures occur, and availability refers to the downtime of the cloud service (Ooteghem, 2022).
Issues in reliability can occur when cloud services are not accessible, when there are frequent

interruptions during use, and if the cloud service is not secure (Ooteghem, 2022). Availability
issues occur when the cloud services are suffering from service outages, resulting in the
unavailability of the service to be accessed by users. The lack of availability of a cloud service
could impact millions of people, as many cloud services are used worldwide on a daily basis,
affecting average citizens, businesses, or government entities.
D. Legal and Regulatory Challenges
Cloud computing can face challenges in the aspects of legality and regulation. Due to the
nature of cloud computing requiring the transferring and storing of data, the aspect of privacy
concerns rise. The European Union created the 1995 Data Protection Directive in order to ensure
the protection of personal data and the transfer of such data, resulting in the transfer of user data
through international to only be permitted by US businesses granted permission (Khatri, 2022).
The hosting of cloud computer services and the use of its data has resulted in many regulations
being put in place, which could result in these cloud services requiring a higher cost by the end
user in order to comply with the regulations which were put in place (GeeksforGeeks, 2022).
