ARCHITECHTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE OF CLOUD
COMPUTING
The architecture and infrastructure of cloud computing are designed to provide scalable,
flexible, and cost-effective solutions for businesses and individuals. To support these goals, cloud
computing offers different service models, including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform
as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).
A. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. Users can access and
manage virtual machines, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources from a
cloud service provider (CSP). It offers a high level of flexibility and control, allowing users to
scale their infrastructure up or down based on their individual/organizational needs.
The responsibility for managing and maintaining the infrastructure lies with the CSP,
allowing you to focus on tasks such as software installation, configuration, and management, as
well as ensuring the security of your data (Google, n.d. -c).
B. Platform as a Service (PaaS):

PaaS provides a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications. Similar to
IaaS models, in PaaS, the service provider takes care of delivering and managing the underlying
infrastructure. While you are responsible for coding, handling data, and managing your
applications, the burden of managing and maintaining the platform itself is alleviated.
PaaS solutions are specific to application and software development and typically include:
• Cloud infrastructure: Data centers, storage, network equipment, and servers
• Middleware software: Operating systems, frameworks, development kits (SDK),
libraries, and more
• User interface: A graphical user interface (GUI), a command line interface (CLI), an API
interface, and in some cases, all three (Google, n.d. -e).
C. Software as a Service (SaaS):
Through SaaS, software applications are hosted and delivered over the internet. Users can
access and use software applications without the need for local installation or management which
provides convenience, accessibility, and comes with automatic software updates. Some key
features of SaaS include:
• Application Accessibility: SaaS applications are accessible through web browsers or
dedicated client applications, allowing users to access them from various devices and
locations.
• Multi-Tenancy: SaaS applications support multiple users or organizations sharing the
same software instance while maintaining data separation and security.
• Subscription-based Model: SaaS typically operates on a subscription-based pricing
model, where users pay for the software on a recurring basis (SalesForce, n.d.).
D. Virtualization and its role in cloud computing:
Virtualization plays a fundamental role in enabling the service models of previously
mentioned above. Through virtualization, the cloud service provider can efficiently allocate and
manage resources, dynamically scale up or down based on demand, and ensure the isolation and
security of user environments. It is the foundation that enables the scalability, flexibility, and
agility that cloud computing is known for (AWS, n.d.).
Virtualization uses specialized software, called a hypervisor, to create several cloud
instances or virtual machines on one physical computer. From the user’s perspective, the virtual
machine operates like a typical server. CPUs, Random Access Memory (RAM), and storage
appear the same as on a physical server. You can also configure and update the guest operating
systems and their applications as necessary without affecting the host operating system (AWS,
n.d.).
The hypervisor is installed on the physical machine, serving as a mediator between the
virtual machines and the underlying hardware or host operating system. It operates as a software
layer that facilitates the allocation of physical resources to multiple virtual machines. By
coordinating access to the physical environment, the hypervisor ensures that each virtual
machine has its dedicated portion of resources.
For example, if the virtual machine requires computing resources, such as computer
processing power, the request first goes to the hypervisor. The hypervisor then passes the request
to the underlying hardware, which performs the task (AWS, n.d.).
The following are the two main types of hypervisors.

• Type 1 hypervisors: Also called a bare-metal hypervisor, runs directly on the computer
hardware and interacts directly with the physical resources.
• Type 2 hypervisors: Runs as an application on computer hardware with an existing
operating system. This type of hypervisor is used when running multiple operating
systems on a single machine.
