CONCLUSION
A. Summary of Key Findings and Insights
Cloud Computing has forever revolutionized and transformed the way companies and
users store, access, process and deliver information and services.  It offers a long list of benefits
dependent on the specific use case but scalability, cost efficiency and flexibility are massive
benefits for everyone.  However, that is not to say that it comes without its own challenges
including security, reliability, legal/regulatory constraints and potential privacy issues when
handling sensitive data.  In this paper, we have explored cloud deployment models, architecture,
infrastructure, benefits, limitations and current technology and tools.  We were also able to apply
this to the real world through case studies and examples of companies that have greatly benefited
from implementing a cloud computing model.  In the course of this paper, we hope to have
contributed to the understanding and appreciation of cloud computing by exploring the power of
cloud computing, its innovations as well as its challenges and limitations.
B. Future Prospects and Recommendations for Further Research
The topic of Cloud Computing has been widely explored and researched but due to its
rapidly growing nature, there is always more to be explored.  The first issue I would like to see
addressed is the lack of longitudinal studies.  Given the relatively young age of cloud services,
there are very few longitudinal studies available to show its effects over a long period of time.  In
this case, the longitudinal study can view any variable including cost, efficiency, user satisfaction
and its changes over a set period of time.  I believe scope and diversity in research is also a large
issue in the cloud computing space.  As cloud computing grows it is becoming more relevant and
applicable to more companies.  With this being said, research specifically on how it can now
benefit companies that arenâ€™t making use of it would allow for a further testament to its
versatility.  Overall Cloud Computing has proved not only is it here to stay but it is a viable
option that comes with many benefits for all companies across many different fields.
C. Final Thoughts on the Importance of Cloud Computing in the Digital Age
With the evolution of technology, it is now more than ever important for companies to
continue to plan for the future.  Cloud Computing has proven itself to be more than just a trend
rather a necessity in the digital age.  It enables organizations of all fields to leverage the power of
the internet to deliver flexible, reliable and most importantly scalable solutions.  Scalability is
possibly the largest benefit to it allowing for companies to easily up or downscale with little to
no downtime.  This scalability can benefit all sizes of companies as they can utilize their exact
needed resources while having options to rapidly expand with their demands.  With the current
growth of cloud computing, it is evident that it will continue to grow and improve allowing it to
better sever a larger quantity and variety of companies and consumers.  It is imperative

organizations adopt a strategic approach to migrating and implementing cloud computing as soon
as possible allowing them to maximize benefits immediately.  By doing so companies will be
able to reap the benefits of cloud computing and stay ahead of the digital age wave.
